# Storybook Addon Next <!-- omit in toc -->

## ‚ö†Ô∏è DEPRECATED ‚ö†Ô∏è <!-- omit in toc -->

This addon has been deprecated in favor of [@storybook/nextjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@storybook/nextjs) which is the Storybook official addon for supporting Next.js features in Storybook. It supports everything `storybook-addon-next` does and much more! I even worked on developing this with them so you should be in good hands.

Storybook made [migration docs](https://storybook.js.org/recipes/next) to help out. Any issues with migrating should be [opened on Storybook's side](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues).

Going from here, `storybook-addon-next` will support Storybook v7, which comes out on [March 14, 2023](https://storybook.js.org/blog/storybook-day/), to help those migrating, but will only receive security updates for up to 6 months after (ending September 14, 2023).

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install `storybook-addon-next` using [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/storybook-addon-next):

```bash
yarn add --dev storybook-addon-next
```

Or [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/storybook-addon-next):

```bash
npm install --save-dev storybook-addon-next
```

### Register the Addon in main.js

```js
// .storybook/main.js

module.exports = {
  // other config ommited for brevity
  addons: [
    // ...
    'storybook-addon-next'
    // ...
  ]
}
```

### Partay

ü•≥üéâ Thats it! The [supported features](#supported-features) should work out of the box.

See [Documentation](#documentation) for more details on how the supported features work in this addon.

If something doesn't work as you would expect, feel free to [open up an issue](https://github.com/RyanClementsHax/storybook-addon-next/issues).

## Documentation

### Options

This addon can be passed an options object for addional configuration if needed.

For example:

```js
// .storybook/main.js
const path = require('path')

module.exports = {
  // other config ommited for brevity
  addons: [
    // ...
    {
      name: 'storybook-addon-next',
      options: {
        nextConfigPath: path.resolve(__dirname, '../next.config.js')
      }
    }
    // ...
  ]
}
```

- `nextConfigPath`: The absolute path to the `next.config.js`

### Next.js's Image Component (partial support)

[next/image](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image) is [notoriously difficult](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/18393) to get working with storybook. This addon allows you to use Next.js's `Image` component with no configuration!

> Because the image component has features, like image optimization, configured by options that require the Next.js config file to be read and processed by the framework and there is no public function exposed by Next.js to resolve and those options, it is not possible to support those features stably.
>
> If you want to see this better supported, feel free to contribute to the [discussion on Next.js's side](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/40891) or [the discussion on our side](https://github.com/RyanClementsHax/storybook-addon-next/discussions/119)

#### Local Images

[Local images](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization#local-images) work just fine with this addon! Keep in mind that this feature was [only added in Next.js v11](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-11#automatic-size-detection-local-images).

```js
import Image from 'next/image'
import profilePic from '../public/me.png'

function Home() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>My Homepage</h1>
      <Image
        src={profilePic}
        alt="Picture of the author"
        // width={500} automatically provided
        // height={500} automatically provided
        // blurDataURL="../public/me.png" set to equal the image itself (for this addon)
        // placeholder="blur" // Optional blur-up while loading
      />
      <p>Welcome to my homepage!</p>
    </>
  )
}
```

#### Remote Images

[Remote images](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization#remote-images) also work just fine!

```js
import Image from 'next/image'

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>My Homepage</h1>
      <Image
        src="/me.png"
        alt="Picture of the author"
        width={500}
        height={500}
      />
      <p>Welcome to my homepage!</p>
    </>
  )
}
```

#### Optimization

All Next.js `Image`s are automatically [unoptimized](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image#unoptimized) for you.

If [placeholder="blur"](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image#placeholder) is used, the [blurDataURL](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image#blurdataurl) used is the [src](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image#src) of the image (thus effectively disabling the placeholder).

See [this issue](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/18393) for more discussion on how Next.js `Image`s are handled for Storybook.

#### AVIF

This format is not supported by this addon yet. Feel free to [open up an issue](https://github.com/RyanClementsHax/storybook-addon-next/issues) if this is something you want to see.

### Next.js Routing

This solution is heavily based on [storybook-addon-next-router](https://github.com/lifeiscontent/storybook-addon-next-router) so a big thanks to `lifeiscontent` for providing a good solution that this addon could work off of.

[Next.js's router](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction) is automatically stubbed for you so that when the router is interacted with, all of its interactions are automatically logged to the [Storybook actions tab](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/actions) if you have the actions addon.

#### Overriding defaults

Per-story overrides can be done by adding a `nextRouter` property onto the story [parameters](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/parameters). The addon will shallowly merge whatever you put here into the router.

```js
import SomeComponentThatUsesTheRouter from "./SomeComponentThatUsesTheRouter";

export default {
  title: "My Story",
};

// if you have the actions addon
// you can click the links and see the route change events there
export const Example = () => <SomeComponentThatUsesTheRouter />;

Example.parameters: {
  nextRouter: {
    path: "/profile/[id]",
    asPath: "/profile/ryanclementshax",
    query: {
      id: "ryanclementshax"
    }
  }
}
```

See this [example](https://github.com/RyanClementsHax/storybook-addon-next/blob/main/examples/nextv12/stories/pages/nextjsRouting.stories.jsx) for a reference.

#### Global Defaults

Global defaults can be set in [preview.js](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/overview#configure-story-rendering) and will be shallowly merged with the default router.

```js
export const parameters = {
  nextRouter: {
    path: '/some-default-path',
    asPath: '/some-default-path',
    query: {}
  }
}
```

See this [example](https://github.com/RyanClementsHax/storybook-addon-next/blob/main/examples/nextv12/.storybook/preview.js) for a reference.

#### Default Router

The default values on the stubbed router are as follows (see [globals](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/toolbars-and-globals#globals) for more details on how globals work)

```ts
const defaultRouter = {
  locale: context?.globals?.locale,
  route: '/',
  pathname: '/',
  query: {},
  asPath: '/',
  push(...args: unknown[]) {
    action('nextRouter.push')(...args)
    return Promise.resolve(true)
  },
  replace(...args: unknown[]) {
    action('nextRouter.replace')(...args)
    return Promise.resolve(true)
  },
  reload(...args: unknown[]) {
    action('nextRouter.reload')(...args)
  },
  back(...args: unknown[]) {
    action('nextRouter.back')(...args)
  },
  prefetch(...args: unknown[]) {
    action('nextRouter.prefetch')(...args)
    return Promise.resolve()
  },
  beforePopState(...args: unknown[]) {
    action('nextRouter.beforePopState')(...args)
  },
  events: {
    on(...args: unknown[]) {
      action('nextRouter.events.on')(...args)
    },
    off(...args: unknown[]) {
      action('nextRouter.events.off')(...args)
    },
    emit(...args: unknown[]) {
      action('nextRouter.events.emit')(...args)
    }
  },
  isFallback: false
}
```

#### Actions Integration Caveats

If you override a function, you lose the automatic action tab integration and have to build it out yourself.

```js
export const parameters = {
  nextRouter: {
    push() {
      // we lose the default implementation that logs the action into the action tab
    }
  }
}
```

Doing this yourself looks something like this (make sure you install the `@storybook/addon-actions` package):

```js
import { action } from '@storybook/addon-actions'

export const parameters = {
  nextRouter: {
    push(...args) {
      // custom logic can go here
      // this logs to the actions tab
      action('nextRouter.push')(...args)
      // return whatever you want here
      return Promise.resolve(true)
    }
  }
}
```

### Sass/Scss

[Global sass/scss stylesheets](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#sass-support) are supported without any additional configuration as well. Just import them into [preview.js](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/overview#configure-story-rendering)

```js
import '../styles/globals.scss'
```

This will automatically include any of your [custom sass configurations](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#customizing-sass-options) in your `next.config.js` file.

> Right now only the `.js` extension of the Next.js config is supported, not `.mjs`. See [next.config.js](#nextconfigjs) for more details.

```js
const path = require('path')

module.exports = {
  // any options here are included in sass compilation for your stories
  sassOptions: {
    includePaths: [path.join(__dirname, 'styles')]
  }
}
```

### Css/Sass/Scss Modules

Next.js supports [css modules](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#adding-component-level-css) out of the box so this addon supports it too.

```js
// this import works just fine in Storybook now
import styles from './Button.module.css'
// sass/scss is also supported
// import styles from './Button.module.scss'
// import styles from './Button.module.sass'

export function Button() {
  return (
    <button type="button" className={styles.error}>
      Destroy
    </button>
  )
}
```

### Styled JSX

The built in CSS in JS solution for Next.js is [styled-jsx](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#css-in-js), and this addon supports that out of the box too, zero config.

```js
// This works just fine in Storybook with this addon
function HelloWorld() {
  return (
    <div>
      Hello world
      <p>scoped!</p>
      <style jsx>{`
        p {
          color: blue;
        }
        div {
          background: red;
        }
        @media (max-width: 600px) {
          div {
            background: blue;
          }
        }
      `}</style>
      <style global jsx>{`
        body {
          background: black;
        }
      `}</style>
    </div>
  )
}

export default HelloWorld
```

You can use your own babel config too. This is an example of how you can customize styled-jsx.

```json
// .babelrc or whatever config file you use
{
  "presets": [
    [
      "next/babel",
      {
        "styled-jsx": {
          "plugins": ["@styled-jsx/plugin-sass"]
        }
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

If you use a monorepo, you may need to add the babel config yourself to your storybook project. Just add a babel config to your storybook project with the following contents to get started.

```json
{
  "presets": ["next/babel"]
}
```

### Postcss

Next.js lets you [customize postcss config](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/customizing-postcss-config#default-behavior). Thus this addon will automatically handle your postcss config for you.

This allows for cool things like zero config tailwindcss! See the [with-tailwindcss example](https://github.com/RyanClementsHax/storybook-addon-next/blob/main/examples/with-tailwindcss/README.md) for reference! Its a clone of [Next.js's tailwindcss example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-tailwindcss) set up with storybook and this addon.

### Absolute Imports

Goodbye `../`! Absolute imports from the root directory work just fine with this addon.

```js
// All good!
import Button from 'components/button'
// Also good!
import styles from 'styles/HomePage.module.css'

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1 className={styles.title}>Hello World</h1>
      <Button />
    </>
  )
}
```

```js
// preview.js

// Also ok in preview.js!
import 'styles/globals.scss'

// ...
```

### Runtime Config

Next.js allows for [Runtime Configuration](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/runtime-configuration) which lets you import a handy `getConfig` function to get certain configuration defined in your `next.config.js` file at runtime.

In the context of Storybook with this addon, you can expect Next.js's [Runtime Configuration](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/runtime-configuration) feature to work just fine.

Note, because Storybook doesn't server render your components, your components will only see what they normally see on the client side (i.e. they won't see `serverRuntimeConfig` but will see `publicRuntimeConfig`).

For example, consider the following Next.js config:

```js
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  serverRuntimeConfig: {
    mySecret: 'secret',
    secondSecret: process.env.SECOND_SECRET // Pass through env variables
  },
  publicRuntimeConfig: {
    staticFolder: '/static'
  }
}
```

Calls to `getConfig` would return the following object when called within Storybook:

```json
{
  "serverRuntimeConfig": {},
  "publicRuntimeConfig": {
    "staticFolder": "/static"
  }
}
```

### Custom Webpack Config

Next.js comes with a lot of things for free out of the box like sass support, but sometimes we add [custom webpack config modifications to Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/custom-webpack-config). This addon takes care of most of the webpack modifications you would want to add. If Next.js supports a feature out of the box, then this addon will make that feature work out of the box in Storybook. If Next.js doesn't support something out of the box, but makes it easy to configure, then this addon will do the same for that thing for Storybook. If you find something that you still need to configure webpack to get a Next.js feature to work in Storybook after adding this addon, this is likely a bug and please feel free to [open up an issue](https://github.com/RyanClementsHax/storybook-addon-next/issues).

Any webpack modifications desired for Storybook should be made in [.storybook/main.js](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/webpack) according to Storybook's docs.

Note: Not all webpack modifications are copy/paste-able between `next.config.js` and `.storybook/main.js`. It is recommended to do your reasearch on how to properly make your modifcation to Storybook's webpack config and on how [webpack works](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/).

Please feel free to contribute an [example](https://github.com/RyanClementsHax/storybook-addon-next/blob/main/examples) to help out the community.

Below is an example of how to add svgr support to Storybook with this addon. The full example can be found [here](https://github.com/RyanClementsHax/storybook-addon-next/blob/main/examples/svgr/README.md).

```js
// .storybook/main.js
module.exports = {
  // other config omitted for brevity
  webpackFinal: async config => {
    // this modifies the existing image rule to exclude .svg files
    // since we want to handle those files with @svgr/webpack
    const imageRule = config.module.rules.find(rule => rule.test.test('.svg'))
    imageRule.exclude = /\.svg$/

    // configure .svg files to be loaded with @svgr/webpack
    config.module.rules.push({
      test: /\.svg$/,
      use: ['@svgr/webpack']
    })

    return config
  }
}
```

### Typescript

Storybook handles most [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) configurations, but this addon adds additional support for Next.js's support for [Absolute Imports and Module path aliases](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/module-path-aliases). In short, it takes into account your `tsconfig.json`'s [baseUrl](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#baseUrl) and [paths](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#paths). Thus, a `tsconfig.json` like the one below would work out of the box.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/components/*": ["components/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

### next.config.js

#### ESM

Right now the only supported config format for Next.js that this plugin supports is the commonjs version of the config (i.e. `next.config.js`). This is mostly because I haven't figured out how to require a `.mjs` file from a storybook addon (which is bound to commonjs modules as far as I know right now). If you are able to help, I'd love it if you could contribute to [this discussion](https://github.com/RyanClementsHax/storybook-addon-next/discussions/28) to get support for the `.mjs` version if such support is even possible.

### Notes for Yarn v2 and v3 users

If you're using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) v2 or v3, you may run into issues where Storybook can't resolve `style-loader` or `css-loader`. For example, you might get errors like:

`Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'css-loader'`\
`Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'style-loader'`

This is because those versions of Yarn have different package resolution rules than Yarn v1.x. If this is the case for you, just install the package directly.

### FAQ

#### Statically imported images won't load

Make sure you are treating image imports the same way you treat them when using next image in normal development.

Before `storybook-addon-next`, image imports just imported the raw path to the image (e.g. `'static/media/stories/assets/plugin.svg'`). When using `storybook-addon-next` image imports work the "Next.js way" meaning that we now get an object when we import an image. For example:

```json
{
  "src": "static/media/stories/assets/plugin.svg",
  "height": 48,
  "width": 48,
  "blurDataURL": "static/media/stories/assets/plugin.svg"
}
```

Therefore, if something in storybook isn't showing the image properly, make sure you expect the object to be returned from an import instead of just the asset path.

See [local images](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization#local-images) for more detail on how Next.js treats static image imports.

#### This addon breaks when the .mjs extension for the next config is used

Right now using `next.config.mjs` isn't supported by this addon. See [next.config.js](#nextconfigjs) for more details. Right now, it is required for you to use the `.js` extension instead. Feel free to help out on [this discussion](https://github.com/RyanClementsHax/storybook-addon-next/discussions/28) to get this supported.

#### Module not found: Error: Can't resolve [package name]

You might get this if you're using Yarn v2 or v3. See [Notes for Yarn v2 and v3 users](#notes-for-yarn-v2-and-v3-users) for more details.
